# Description

NoteXtract is a C# application that extracts text from presentations and generates a text file.

# Breakdown

Built using the MonoGame framework and uses the iTextSharp library to parse PDF files.

# Why?

As a college student, I've made it a habit of transferring my handwritten notes, that were copied from a PDF/Slideshow, to a digital note app. As time goes on I get more and more tired of doing that. So why not streamline the process and code something up to do that transfer step for me? And just like that NoteXtract was born.
